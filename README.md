# Predicting Diabetes Using Tree-Based Methods
The dataset I will be using in the following parts is the "Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset". This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

# Objective of Project
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
